# ChatGPT-InputOutput-Compression
This project is an attempt to leverage chatGPT to create a compression technique to better leverage token availability within the model. The hope is that a codification scheme can be developed in order to amplify the effective number of tokens available to a user and decrease the constraint created by the limitation of available tokens in a prompt.
